# MERN Stack E-Commerce App

This is a full-stack eCommerce application built with the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**. 
It includes essential features like product listings, a shopping cart, and dynamic item quantity management. 
I'm currently building and expanding the project as part of my journey to become a professional full-stack developer.
